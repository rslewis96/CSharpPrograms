# CSharpPrograms
This purpose of this repository is to store and show case programs I have created for fun in C#.

**KaijuGuessingGame:**
Stored in the zip file is the source code and the EXE(this can be found in the debug folder). The program was setup to
use local folder/file location. Over time I'll add more Kaiju to the list. At somepoint, I'll modify it to be more of a general 
guessing game rather than be specific.

**FizzBuzz:**
This was given as an interview question. 

Instructions:
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”.
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.
