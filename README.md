# CSharpPrograms
This purpose of this repository is to store and show case programs I have created for fun in C#.

**KaijuGuessingGame:**
I stored this as a zip. Stored in the zip file is the source code and the EXE(this can be found in the debug folder). The program was setup to
use local folder/file location. Over time I add more Kaiju to the list.
